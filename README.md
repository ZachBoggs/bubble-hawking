# bubble-hawking
bubble-hawking is a C++ application that combines real-time graphical effects with text-to-speech synthesis using eSpeak NG. Holding the spacebar spawns and animates bubbles on screen while a synthetic Stephen Hawking–like voice repeats “bubbles,” dynamically increasing in pitch, speed, and volume for an escalating audiovisual experience.

## building

Build with cmake into the build directory.

Once you have done this, then you want to use make to build the project which will produce a bubbleHawking executable file that you can run if compiled right.
